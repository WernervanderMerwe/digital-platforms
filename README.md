# Interview test

This is an interview test based on .NET and C# development using Visual Studio but I am answering these questions building out a webpage
with HTML forms to input data to my JavaScript logic and render the corresponding answers to the questions
all while printing the answers out in console as asked.

# Database questions

I have very limited prior database knowledge, I have worked with DBeaver as a database administration tool and I have used some SQLite in the past
so I chose to use it for the relational database question
